# Rental-Database

This is a web application which enables users to access and interact with rental information, implementing several key functionalities:
  Property Listings: Displays all property IDs along with the names of their owners and any associated managers.
  Rental Group Preferences: Allows existing rental groups to update their preferences.
  Rental Group Details: Provides a listing of all rental groups, enabling users to select one and view the names of the students in that group along with their rental preferences.
  Average Rent Table: Presents a table that shows the average monthly rent for different categories of rental units—houses, apartments, and rooms—organized into three columns.

In this project I turned a previously created ER diagram into a relational schema using SQL. I created a MySQL database named rentalDB. The application consists of multiple web pages and is designed for user-friendly navigation. Relevant data is extracted by SQL queries and displayed in tables. The site incorporates basic HTML, CSS, and PHP, using PDO for database interactions.
